      <strong>Written on my personal blog.</strong>

        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm sure you've come across the same title in many
          videos/blogs. But every person has a different story and different
          learnings. And this is mine. I hope you can take away at least a
          couple of learnings from this blog. Let's start with the 5 mistakes I
          did and how you could avoid them.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Not sticking to a single resource :</strong>
            <p>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; The Internet is abundant with resources to learn
              pretty much anything. And the coding community is very strong.
              Every day I'd pick a new creator. I'd jump from one resource to
              another without actually completing the previous one. This led to
              chaotic and messy learning. If I could start over, I'd pick only a
              single resource and stick to it until it is completed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not having a personalized plan/roadmap :</strong>
            <p>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Sure, you have had many people guiding you about
              what to learn, how to learn, and where to start. Even, I trusted
              othersâ€™ roadmap blindly. But that got me nowhere. Since there are
              many roadmaps out there, I wasn't able to follow one of them
              completely. Part of it comes from the lack of trust or fear of
              missing out. But this time, I'll do my due diligence and come up
              with my plan (Of course, I'll lift from various resources - that's
              how the learning happens ðŸ™‚ )
            </p>
          </li>
          <div class="blog-image">
            <img src="/images/chaotic-learning.jpeg" alt="Blog image 1" />
          </div>
          <li>
            <strong>Not practicing enough :</strong>
            <p>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Every other creator advises practicing more. But,
              everyone feels this. We watch a tutorial or read a blog, it makes
              us feel like we know things, that we don't need to practice them.
              But trust me, it is because of the creators who have simplified
              things so much that we think it is easy for us, but in reality,
              the creators themselves went through the learning curve and made
              things easy for themselves. So, be it a small thing or a big
              thing, I'll practice it anyway. There's no harm in practicing you
              know :)
            </p>

          <li>
            <strong>Getting into tutorial hell :</strong>
            <p>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; It's been almost a year since I first heard of these
              words, TUTORIAL HELL. Let me spell it out for you. The tutorial
              hell is real and it's tough to not only get out of it but to even
              realize that we are stuck in one. This can be solved easily by
              choosing the right plan to study. The best way is to choose
              project-based learning and put in equal time out of the course on
              projects that are your own. Google for projects. You'll find many
              project titles. Just take the idea, and make the code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Not documenting my journey : </strong>
            <p>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; I wasn't sure about documenting my learning. Even
              before trying this for real, it felt as if I'm creating
              educational content and that I can't do it every day like others.
              But I was wrong. Documenting doesn't necessarily mean that you
              should get likes and followers for your content. It means letting
              the world know that you are learning irrespective of whether the
              world cares about you or not. As I'm reaching the end of this
              article, I realize documenting is fun. It need not be a chore to
              do as I thought. Keep aside your fears and start expressing
              yourself, this may or may not help other people. But this will
              help you in unexpected ways for sure. Go for it. Do not think that
              they can only be blogs or videos, you can make posts, tweets, or
              anything you want. Take the plunge and you'll find your way
              eventually.

          something from this.
