        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; There are many things I learned from Neogcamp. First, I
          want to take a moment to appreciate myself for successfully completing
          level Zero projects. For those who don't know about Neogcamp, it is a
          full-stack development Bootcamp. To enter into it, you must complete
          level zero and submit your projects. Don't worry theyâ€™ll teach you how
          to make and what to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I heard about this a year ago. But I didn't try it back
          then. And I still regret not giving it a shot. As a 2022 graduate
          without a job, I was searching frantically for a job and learning
          simultaneously to crack something big. Thatâ€™s when I came across the
          alumni of Neogcamp on Twitter. The community they built was very warm
          and comforting. Then I saw some more posts and soon I wanted to be a
          part of that. Unfortunately, it had only 2 cohorts every year.
          Fortunately, the admissions weren't open yet and the next cohort was
          in Jan 2023. Realizing it's not too late, I started this on the 5th of
          September 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Previously, I took a couple of courses on Web
          development and I knew I hold some interest in that domain. I even
          completed a few courses. I made a few projects which included the
          backend as well. I made a complete full-stack application by end of a
          course. But my learning was not up to the mark. I followed everything
          they said and knew what to do when a project is started. Yet, I was
          unable to make projects on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; For the first lesson, I was very thrilled at the idea of
          making something in just 2 hrs and being able to show that app to my
          friends and family. And I did find it quite fun. By taking Tanay's
          (the instructor) tips, I coded after the tutorial and not while
          watching it. And I completed the projects without finding the need to
          watch them again. That was very refreshing and boosted my confidence a
          lot. I felt as if I'd done something. The cherry on the cake is that
          all this is free of cost. Yes, you heard it right, it is available for
          free on youtube and the only things you need to put in are your time
          and effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; You can complete this in less than 20 days. I was a bit
          lazy and inconsistent due to my commitment to learning other things.
          It took me 20 days approx. At the end of 20 days, I have a
          ready-to-show portfolio with some small but cool projects which can
          demonstrate my skills better than a few words on my resume.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know if I'll get in for Level One, but I'm
          content with what I've done and learned from level Zero for now.
          Looking forward to leveling up and continuing my journey with
          neogcamp.
